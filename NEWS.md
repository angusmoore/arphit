# arphit v0.4.0 Release Notes

## New features

 * Time series graphs now automatically add a small margin of spacing to the right hand side
 if the data is close to the right hand axis. You can stop this by setting a manual x-limit
 for the right hand side. Vertically divided time series graphs always add a margin. 
 ([#292](https://github.com/angusmoore/arphit/pull/292))
 * Export a list of graphs as a GIF animation ([#293](https://github.com/angusmoore/arphit/pull/293))
