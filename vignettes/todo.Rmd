This document outlines some of arphit's limitations with respect to many of the standard graphs used by the RBA. It also lists some of the planned improvements.

# Limitations

## Undated graphs

Currently, only time series graphs are supported. `arphit` was built with the purpose of integrating into forecasting infrastructure, so focused on time series. Supporting undated graphs might be considered if there is sufficient demand.

## Month or quarter x-ticks

As above, `arphit` was built with forecasting in mind. High-frequency and short-sample time series are not an important use case and so are not supported.

# Planned improvements

Nothing currently.
