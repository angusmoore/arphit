This document outlines some of arphit's limitations.

You should consult the issues list (https://github.com/angusmoore/arphit/issues) for a list of known bugs and planned feature improvements. If you find a bug or have a feature to suggest, please report it there.

# Limitations

## Month or quarter x-ticks

`arphit` can only do yearly labels for time series data. If you have a short, high frequency time series, it will not show monthly or quarterly time series.

## Limited graphs

Only line, bar and scatter graphs are supported.

# Planned feature improvements

## Auto labeller

Automatically place series labels on graphs (when needed) in available white space.
