This vignette details all the plotting options available in `arphit`. If you are learning how to use `arphit`, you should read the [getting started guide](getting-started.html) first.

# Data types

## `tibble`s and `data.frame`s

## `ts`


# Layouts and panels

There are nine supported layouts, with up to 8 panels. *Right hand side axes count as separate panels in some layouts.* Panels are numbered from left to right, top to bottom.

  1. One-panel "1". This is the default if you do not supply a value for `layout`. Despite its name this layout has *two* panels. Panel "1" corresponds to the left axis; panel "2" corresponds to the right axis.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "1")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
library(arphit)
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "1"), filename = "layout_1.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_1.png")
```  

  2. Two-panel vertical "2v". This layout has two panels, divided vertically. Panel "1" is the left panel, panel "2" the right.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "2v")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "2v"), filename = "layout_2v.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_2v.png")
```  

  3. Two-panel horizontal "2h". This layout has *four* panels. Panels "1" and "2" are the left and
right axes of the top panel. "3" and "4" for the bottom.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "2h")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "2h"), filename = "layout_2h.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_2h.png")
```  
  
  4. Two-by-two "2b2". This layout is very similar to "2h", except the left and right panels are divided, rather than axes.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "2b2")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "2b2"), filename = "layout_2b2.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_2b2.png")
```  

  5. Three panel vertical "3v":
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "3v")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "3v"), filename = "layout_3v.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_3v.png")
```  
  6. Three panel horizontal "3h" (has left and right axes, like "2h"):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "3h")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "3h"), filename = "layout_3h.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_3h.png")
```  

  7. Six panel three-by-two "3b2":
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "3b2")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "3b2"), filename = "layout_3b2.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_3b2.png")
```  

  8. Four panel horizontal "4h" (has left and right axes like "2h"):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "4h")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "4h"), filename = "layout_4h.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_4h.png")
```  

  9. Eight panel four-by-two "4b2":
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(layout = "4b2")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_draw(arphitgg(layout = "4b2"), filename = "layout_4b2.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layout_4b2.png")
```  

# Layers and aesthetics

## Aesthetic

An aesthetic is the definition of a layer. It tells arphit you to display the data.

### `x` and `y`

The `x` and `y` variables speak for themselves, and must be values in the data you supply. (`x` values can be categorical).
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + 
  agg_line(data = simple_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1))
agg_draw(p, filename = "no-group-aes.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("no-group-aes.png")
```

If your data are a `ts`, the `x` aesthetic does not need to specified, it is automatically the dates in the time series.

Aesthetics inherit from their parent. That is, if you omit part of an aesthetic in the definition of a layer, it will inherit from the parent (if it exists). If you specify both a parent aesthetic and a layer aesthetic, the layer aesthetic overrides.

In this example, the whole aesthetic is inherited:
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg(data = simple_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1)) + 
  agg_line()
agg_draw(p, filename = "inherit-aes-all.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("inherit-aes-all.png")
```

In this example, we specify the`x` aesthetic in the parent, but specify the y aesthetic in the layer. This is helpful if, for instance, you have many `y` variables you want to plot that all have the same `x` variable.
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg(data = simple_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date)) + 
  agg_line(aes = agg_aes(y = y1))
agg_draw(p, filename = "inherit-aes-some.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("inherit-aes-some.png")
```

### Groups

An aesthetic can also specify a `group` variable. This is used when your data is in long form and you have multiple observations on each `x` observation, corresponding to different variables. For instance, `x` might be the date column, `y` the column containing observations of the unemployment rate and `group` the column containing state identifiers.
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() +
  agg_line(data = long_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1, group = group_var))
agg_draw(p, filename = "group-aes.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("group-aes.png")
```

### Facets

An aesthetic can also specify a `facet` variable. `facet`s work like `group`s, except that facets are split across panels (and so layers ignore if you give them a panel).
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() +
  agg_line(data = long_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1, facet = group_var))
agg_draw(p, filename = "facet.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("facet.png")
```

Data can have both `group`s and `facet`s.
```{r, results = "hide"}
facet_data <- data.frame(x = rep(c(1,2),4),
                         y = rnorm(8),
                         age = c(rep("A", 4), rep("B", 4)),
                         sex = rep(c("F","F","M","M"), 2))
p <- arphitgg() +
  agg_line(data = long_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y, group = sex, facet = age))
agg_draw(p, filename = "facet-group.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("facet-group.png")
```

## Layers

A layer is a series (or group of series) built from the same aesthetic. In `arphit`, layers must be assigned to a panel.

Layers take four arguments:
  1. Data
  2. Aesthetic
  3. Panel (defaults to "1" if not supplied)
  4. Colour (optional, and discussed below)

There are three types of layers, `agg_line`, `agg_point` and `agg_col`. These are used nearly identically to produce line, scatter and column graphs respectively:
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg(layout = "2h") + 
  agg_line(data = long_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1, group = group_var), panel = "1") + 
  agg_col(data = long_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y2, group = group_var), panel = "3")
agg_draw(p, filename = "layers.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("layers.png")
```

```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg(layout = "1") + 
  agg_point(data = data.frame(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10)), aes = agg_aes(x = x, y = y), panel = "1")
agg_draw(p, filename = "scatter.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("scatter.png")
```

Layers will inherit data and aesthetic (or parts of the aesthetic) if these are left null in the layer specification. This is handy to save you from having to repeat yourself:
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg(long_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, group = group_var), layout = "2h") + 
  agg_line(aes = agg_aes(y = y1), panel = "1") + 
  agg_col(aes = agg_aes(y = y2), panel = "3")
agg_draw(p, filename = "inherit.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("inherit.png")
```

### Line layers


### Column/bar layers


### Point/scatter layers

# Series colours and other attributes

## Colours

Specifying line, bar or point (depending on layer type) colours for series is done when creating a layer. For instance:
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + 
  agg_line(data = simple_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1), color = RBA["Red1"])
agg_draw(p, filename = "simplecolor.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("simplecolor.png")
```

This color is applied to _all_ series in the layer. This is less helpful when you have a group variable, since they will all show up as the same colour (which is unlikely to be what you want). E.g. this is not helpful:
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() +
  agg_line(data = long_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1, group = group_var), color = RBA["Red1"])
agg_draw(p, filename = "group-single-color.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("group-single-color.png")
```

To specify for different colours for different series in a grouped layer, you can instead specify a _vector_ of colours:
```{r, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() +
  agg_line(data = long_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1, group = group_var), color = c(RBA["Red1"], RBA["Blue4"]))
agg_draw(p, filename = "group-multi-color.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("group-multi-color.png")
```

(NB: `arphit` will cycle through the supplied vector colours if there aren't enough in the vector to cover the number of series in the layer.)

To see the full list of availble colours type `vignette("rba-colours", package = "arphit")`.

Alternatively, you can use any colour that R recognises.

If you don't specify colours, arphit cycles through a set of default colours. Should you need to (e.g. for labels) you can access the default colors using the alias `RBA["Default1"]` etc.

### (Advanced) Defining your own default colors

If you want to define your own set of default colors to be used define a vector called `ARPHIT_USERCOLORS` before you load `arphit`. Putting this into your `.Rprofile` is sensible.

## Line markers

`pch` allows you to add markers to your series. These directly follow the R options. These are specified like colours (setting one will apply it to all series in the layer, a vector will be cycled through).

[example]

## Line type

`lty` allows you to control the line type - e.g. add dashing. These directly follow the R options. These are specified like colours (setting one will apply it to all series in the layer, a vector will be cycled through).

[example]

## Line width

`lwd` controls the width of the line. 1 corresponds to default. 2 to twice default, 0.5 half it, etc. These are specified like colours (setting one will apply it to all series in the layer, a vector will be cycled through).

[example]

## Bar outline

`barcol` lets you set the colour of the bar outline for `agg_col` layers. By default, this is `NA`, meaning no outline. These are specified like colours (setting one will apply it to all series in the layer, a vector will be cycled through).

[example]

# Titles and subtitles

Titles and subtitles are added using `agg_title` and `agg_subtitle` respectively. The only required argument is the text for the title/subtitle:
```{r results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + agg_title("Graph Title Goes Here") + agg_subtitle("Or a subtitle, if you like")
agg_draw(p, filename = "title.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("title.png")
```

To add panel titles, specify a panel identifier in the `agg_title` or `agg_subtitle` call:
```{r results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + agg_title("Graph Title Goes Here") + agg_subtitle("Or a subtitle, if you like") + 
  agg_title("And here is panel title", panel = "1") + agg_subtitle("Panel subtitle too if needed", panel = "1")
agg_draw(p, filename = "paneltitle.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("paneltitle.png")
```

`arphit` will automatically place linebreaks in long titles but may not be smart enough in all cases. You can insert linebreaks yourself as necessary by using "\\n".

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg() + 
  agg_title("Here is a very very very long title that arphit will automatically put a break in") +
  agg_subtitle("And a subtitle\nwith a manual break too")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + 
  agg_title("Here is a very very very long title that arphit will automatically put a break in") +
  agg_subtitle("And a subtitle\nwith a manual break too")
agg_draw(p, filename = "longtitle.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("longtitle.png")
```

# Panel titles and subtitles

You can add titles and subtitles to panels in much the same way as titles and subtitles. Allyou do is specify `panel` as an argument:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg() + 
  agg_title("Panel title for panel 1", panel = "1") +
  agg_subtitle("And a subtitle", panel = "1")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + 
  agg_title("Panel title for panel 1", panel = "1") +
  agg_subtitle("And a subtitle", panel = "1")
agg_draw(p, filename = "paneltitles.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("paneltitles.png")
```

# Units

You can specify the units for your graph using the `agg_units` function. This can be used either with or without a panel specifier. If called without a panel specifier, the units are applied to all panels, otherwise the units are added only to specified panel:
```{r results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + agg_units("index")
agg_draw(p, filename = "units-all.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("units-all.png")
```

```{r results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + agg_units("index", panel = "1") + agg_units("ppt", panel = "2")
agg_draw(p, filename = "units-specific.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("units-specific.png")
```

## x-axis units

You can also add units for the x-axis in much the same way. These are ignored for anything other than scatter graphs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arphitgg(scatterdata, agg_aes(x=x,y=y)) + agg_point() + agg_xunits("ppt")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg(scatterdata, agg_aes(x=x,y=y)) + agg_point() + agg_xunits("ppt")
agg_draw(p, filename = "x-units.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("x-units.png")
```

# Sources and footnotes

Adding sources and footnotes is done using `agg_source` and `agg_footnote`. You can pass in a single text string, or a vector of multiple strings. You can add as many `agg_source`/`agg_footnote` as you like:
```{r results = "hide"}
p <- arphitgg() + agg_source("Source 1") + agg_source(c("Source 2 (as a vector)", "Source 3 (vectors are easy!")) + 
  agg_footnote("This is my first footnoote") + agg_footnote("This is a second footnote")
agg_draw(p, filename = "sources.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("sources.png")
```

# Axis limits

## Y axis

`arphit` will automatically guess axes for each panel. However, it is not smart enough to sensibly line up axes across panels (e.g. if you have left and right axes). And stacked bar graphs will confuse it.

Y-limits can be controlled with `agg_ylim`. This function takes three required arguments: a minimum, a maximum, and the number of steps to include. You can optionally include a panel identifier; if omitted, the limits will be applied to all panels.

### Example 1: Manually setting left and right axes
```{r, eval = FALSE}

```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}

```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

```

### Example 2: Applying the same y axis to all panels
```{r, eval = FALSE}

```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}

```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

```

## X axis

X-limits are controlled using `agg_xlim`. This is similar to y-limits, but only a minimum and maximum is required. For time series graphs, you can use part years if desired by adding decimal places (e.g. `2000.5`).

As with the y-axis you can specify a panel identifier to apply the limits to a specific panel; if you omit the panel identifier, the limits will be applied to all panels.

Fine-grained control of x-ticks is not currently possible; only the limits can be set, the ticks are determined automatically. Time series graphs only support year ticks; higher frequency - such as months or quarters are not supported.

For layouts with vertical division (e.g. "2v", "2b2" etc), you can drop the the first tick of the right hand panel by setting `dropxlabel = TRUE` in `arphitgg`. This prevents the last label of the left hand panel overlapping the first of the right hand panel.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}

```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

```

# Shading between series

You can shade the area between series by adding `agg_shading`. 

Shading is drawn in the order you add it; the first shading added is on the bottom. Series are _always_ drawn on top of shading.
```{r, eval = FALSE}

```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}

```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

```

Multiple shading:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, shading = list(list(from = "x1", to = "x2", color= "red"), list(from = "x3", to = "x4", color = "purple")))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, shading = list(list(from = "x1", to = "x2", color= "red"), list(from = "x3", to = "x4", color = "purple")), filename = "shading-layered.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("shading-layered.png")
```

# Plot annotations

## Adding labels and arrows

You can add series labels, and arrows to aid those labels, using `agg_label` and `agg_arrow` arguments.

`agg_label` takes 5 arguments.
 - `text` is the label text. You can add line breaks in text using the `\n` character.
 - `x` and `y` specify where (in the units on the plot) the centre of the label should be. For time series, `x` is in decimal years (i.e. 2000.5 is July 2, 2000). For categorical graphs, 1 corresponds to the first categories, 2 to the second, etc.
 - `panel` specifies which panel to place the label on.
 - `color` is self-explanatory.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, labels = list(list(x = 2001, y = 2, text = "A label", panel = 1, color = "red"), list(x = 2004, y = 10, text = "A label\n(On two lines!)", panel = 1, color = "green")))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, labels = list(list(x = 2001, y = 2, text = "A label", panel = 1, color = "red"), list(x = 2002, y = 10, text = "A label\n(On two lines!)", panel = 1, color = "green")), filename = "labels.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("labels.png")
```

Arrows are specified with `agg_arrow`. `tail.x` and `tail.y` specify the coordinates (in the units on the plot) of where to start the arrow at, `head.x` and `head.y` where to finish it. `panel` specifies which panel to place the arrow on. `color` is self-explanatory. `lwd` is optional and specifies the linewidth of the arrow (default = 1).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, arrows = list(list(tail.x = 2000, tail.y = 10, head.x = 2001, head.y = 1, color = "darkred", panel = 1)))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, arrows = list(list(tail.x = 2000, tail.y = 10, head.x = 2001, head.y = 1, color = "darkred", panel = 1)), filename = "arrows.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("arrows.png")
```

## Adding horizonal and vertical lines

A list of lists specifying line segments to add to the plot. Each of the sublists specifies a single line segment to add. These can be specified in three ways. The most common way is specifying either a horizontal or vertical line that stretches across the panel. Do this by having a sublist entry similar to `list(x = 2001, panel = 1, color = "green", lty = 1)`. `x` is where, on the x-axis, the line will be drawn. `panel` specifies which panel to draw on. `color` is self-explanatory and is optional (default black). `lty` specifies what line type to use (see R lty options) - it is optional and defaults to 1 (solid). To draw a horizontal line use y instead of x.

The following example draws a vertical line at 2001 using the default colour and solid line. It also draws a horizontal line at -1 colored darkred and dashed (`lty = 2`).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, lines = list(list(x = 2001, panel = 1), list(y = -1, color = "darkred", panel = 1, lty = 2)))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, lines = list(list(x = 2001, panel = 1), list(y = -1, color = "darkred", panel = 1, lty = 2)), filename = "lines.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("lines.png")
```

If you want more control, you can specify the coordinates of the line segment instead of using `x` or `y`.  To do so use `list(x1 = 2000, y1 = -1, x2 = 2001, y2 = 0, panel = 1)` instead of x and y. All other options are the same. For example:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, lines = list(list(x1 = 2000, y1 = -10, x2 = 2002, y2 = 5, panel = 1)))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, lines = list(list(x1 = 2000, y1 = -10, x2 = 2002, y2 = 5, panel = 1)), filename = "specificlines.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("specificlines.png")
```

Entering NA for any of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2` will set that coordinate to the axis limit (with `x1` and `y1` going to the left and bottom axes and `x2` and `y2` to the right and top).

## Adding background shading

Background shading can be added using the `bgshading` argument. This is a list of lists specifying background shading to add to the plot. Each of the sublists corresponds to a rectangle of background shading to draw. Each must be of the form: `list(x1 = NA, y1 = -1, x2 = NA, y2 = 1, panel = 1, color = "lightgrey")`. `x1` and `x2` correspond to the bottom left corner; `x2`, `y2` the top right. Passing NA will set that coordinate to the axis limit - this is useful for creating shading that stretches across a whole panel. `color` and `panel` are self-explanatory (color is optional and defaults to light grey).

This example creates horizontal shading across the whole panel between -1 and 3 on the y axis.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, bgshading = list(list(x1 = NA, y1 = -1, x2 = NA, y2 = 3, panel = 1)))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, bgshading = list(list(x1 = NA, y1 = -1, x2 = NA, y2 = 3, panel = 1)), filename = "shading1.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("shading1.png")
```

And this two panel example repeats the above example for panel 1, but puts light green shading between two dates on the bottom panel.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, layout = "2h", series = list("1" = "x4", "3" = "x2"), bgshading = list(list(x1 = NA, y1 = -1, x2 = NA, y2 = 3, panel = 1), list(x1 = 2000.5, y1 = NA, x2 = 2001.5, y2 = NA, panel = 3, color = "lightgreen")))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, layout = "2h", series = list("1" = "x4", "3" = "x2"), bgshading = list(list(x1 = NA, y1 = -1, x2 = NA, y2 = 3, panel = 1), list(x1 = 2000.5, y1 = NA, x2 = 2001.5, y2 = NA, panel = 3, color = "lightgreen")), filename = "shading2.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("shading2.png")
```

## Adding axis labels

You can add y and x axis labels to plots using the `yaxislabels` and `xaxislabels` arguments. These take a list (or, to apply the same label to all panels, a string) specifying the axis labels for each panel:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, layout = "2b2", yaxislabels = "A y axis label", xaxislabels = "An x label")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, layout = "2b2", yaxislabels = "A y axis label", xaxislabels = "An x label", filename = "oneaxislabel.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("oneaxislabel.png")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, layout = "2b2", yaxislabels = list("1" = "Foo", "3" = "Bar"), xaxislabels = list("3" = "An x label", "4" = "Another x label")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, layout = "2b2", yaxislabels = list("1" = "Foo", "3" = "Bar"), xaxislabels = list("3" = "An x label", "4" = "Another x label"), filename = "differentaxislabel.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("differentaxislabel.png")
```

## Rotating x ticks

You can rotate x ticks using the `srt` option. It represents the rotation (in degrees):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(categoricaldata, x = "categoryname", srt = 45)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(categoricaldata, x = "categoryname", srt = 45, filename = "xlabel-rotation.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("xlabel-rotation.png")
```

# Joining and missing values

The `joined` argument controls how your graph behaves with missing values. When `joined = TRUE` (which is the default) the series will ignore the missing value and connect to the next non-missing value. When `joined = FALSE` the series will break.

For instance, let's use this series, with the middle observation missing:
```{r}
joining_data <- ts(data.frame(y = c(1,2,NA,3,4)), start = 2000, frequency = 1)
```

With `joined = TRUE`, the series continues straight across the missing value for 2002.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(joining_data, joined = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(joining_data, joined = TRUE, filename = "joined.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("joined.png")
```

But when we set `joined = FALSE`, the series does not connect over the missing observation:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(joining_data, joined = FALSE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(joining_data, joined = FALSE, filename = "unjoined.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("unjoined.png")
```

# Adding a legend

You can add a legend to your graph by setting `legend = TRUE`. You can specify how many columns to have with `lengend.ncol`, but arphit will automatically guess otherwise.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agg_qplot(data, legend = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
agg_qplot(data, legend = TRUE, filename = "legend.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("legend.png")
```

`arphit` will ignore duplicate series in multiple panels (i.e. it will only put in one legend entry).

# Saving to a file

To save your graph to a file instead of displaying it, use `agg_draw` with the optional filename command. `arphit` will determine what file to save as, based on the extension of your filename. `png`, `emf` and `pdf` are supported.
```{r, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
p <- arphitgg(simple_data, aes = agg_aes(x = date, y = y1))
agg_draw(p, filename = "my-graph.png")
```
